<h1 style="font-size:150%;"> <u> What exactly is a favicon? </u> </h1>
<img src="Favicon Example.png" alt="Favicon Example" style="float: left;" width="370px" height="300px">
  <p> <br> <br> A favicon, also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, <br> is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page. <br>
  Favicons are actually great implementations that web-designers have to use to make a page <br> more interactive. Browsers that do support favicons typically display a page's favicon in a <br> list of bookmarks </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> Below are just a few examples of some favicons you may be familar with (with respective links) </p>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><img src="Facebook Favicon.png" height="50px" width="50px"></a>
<a href="https://www.google.com/"><img src="Google Favicon.png" height="50px" width="50px"></a>
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/"><img src="Twitch Favicon.png" height="50px" width="50px"></a>

<h2 style="font-size:150%;"> <u> How are favicons created? </u> </h2>

<img src="favicon-branding_explorer.gif" alt="Favicon Example" style="float: right;" width="150px" height="100px">
  <p> In March 1999, Micrsoft released Internet Explorer, which supported <br>
  favicons for the first time. At this time, the favicon was a file called <br>
  "favicon.log" placed in the root directory of a web site. It was mainly <br> used and seen in the browser's bookmarks and next to the URL in the <br>
  address bar if the page was bookmarked. Now you really don't have <br>
  to bookmark a site for it's favicon to actually show up. When starting <br> to create a favicon, one main thing must come into account. The format <br> for a favicon must be
  16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels, using 6-bit or 24-bit colors. <br> The format of the image must be one of PNG, GIF, or ICO. Creating large detail <br> images  will just not work, going with something simple <br>
  that fits the pixel range and looks nice and fits with the sze is the only way a favicon can be successfully done.

<h3 style="font-size:150%;"> <u> How did I create the favicon for this site? </u> </h3>
  <p> To actually create the favicon for this site, an 8-bit per pixel was used to create the colors. The image is exactly <br>
  17x17 large and fits very well when constructed to the actual size. For better reference, always make favicons <br> basic and easy to read when it is at actual size. The colors were all typed in binary code using the 8-bit <br>
  schmeme.</p>

<p> Below is the binary code of the favicon, to the right is the actual 17x17 image size <img src="Smaller Image.png" alt="Smaller Favicon"> </p>
<br>
<img src="Binary Code Photo.png" alt="Binary Code Photo" width="600px" height="400px">
<br>
<p> This is a lot of binary for just a 17x17 pixel image, right? </p>
